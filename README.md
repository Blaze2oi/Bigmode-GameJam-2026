# SLICK SHIFT (working title)

A top-down action game built in **Godot 4**, where you retrieve items from the past and deliver them through dangerous, slick streets in the future.

The game is inspired by the theme **“SLICK”** — both in movement and in design.  
Everything slides, bounces, and rewards smooth, stylish play.

## 🎮 Core Concept

You are a time-travelling courier.

1. **Start in the Future**  
   You receive a delivery request.

2. **Travel to the Past**  
   Enter a slippery dungeon and clear **3 rooms** to retrieve the item.

3. **Return to the Future**  
   Deliver the item through fast roads filled with other slick drivers.

The better you move, the less you crash — and the more intact your package stays.

## 🧼 Past – Soap Dungeon

- Tight dungeon rooms
- Slippery movement
- Physics-based combat
- Enemies slide and bounce off walls
- Positioning matters more than raw damage

---

## ❄️ Future – Ice Courier

- Open roads
- Momentum-based movement
- Other drifting drivers
- Crashing damages the package
- Smooth navigation is rewarded

---

## 🕹 Controls

### Mouse
- Move toward the mouse cursor  
- The player constantly slips in that direction

### Space
- Short **boost** for speed or correction

### Attack
- Short melee attack
- If your attack hits an enemy → enemy takes damage
- If an enemy hits you while not attacking → you take damage

---

## ❤️ Health & Damage

- Player and enemies both have health
- Attacking at the right moment is key
- Reckless sliding is punished

---

## 🛠 Built With

- **Godot Engine 4.x**
- GDScript
- 2D physics (CharacterBody2D)

---

## 🚧 Development Status

This project is currently in active development for a game jam.

Planned / in progress:
- Room progression
- Package damage system
- Scoring
- Visual polish
- Sound effects

## 📜 Theme Explanation – “SLICK”

“Slick” is expressed through:
- Slippery, momentum-based movement
- Wall ricochets and physics combat
- Smooth, continuous motion
- A clever time-switching structure between preparation (past) and execution (future)

The goal is to make players feel **cool and clever** when things go right — and punished when they aren’t smooth.
